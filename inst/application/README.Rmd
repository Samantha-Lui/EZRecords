# **EZRecords App**



## Overview

EZRecords App is an application designed for a small retail business for bookkeeping and management of stock. Upon 
data entry of a transaction (sale, purchase of the materials, other expenses, etc), the status of stock 
is updated, and the record of the transaction will be ready to view or use for future calculations and analyses.

This application was built on R(3.3.2) and required public-licensed packages *shiny*, *shinyjs*, *dplyr*, and *tidyr* 
and private package [*EZRecords*](https://github.com/Samantha-Lui/EZRecords).
