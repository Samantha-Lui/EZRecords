    | amount(obj, ...)   | calculate the value of the item                              |
    | discount(obj, ...) | calculate the remaining fraction a value after it is discounted                          |
    | is_empty(obj)      | check if the object has only trivial slots  |
    | print(obj, ...)    | siliently returns a representation of its argument as character string                 |

    |--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | add(obj, item, ...)| appends an item to athe list _items_ 
    | amount(obj, ...)   | calculates the value of the object and returns the result                              |
    | discount(obj, ...) | returns the remaining fraction a value after it is discounted                          |
    | is_empty(obj)      | checks if the object has only trivial slots and returns a boolean value for the result |
    | print(obj, ...)    | siliently returns a representation of its argument as character string                 |
